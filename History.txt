=== July 12, 2008

  * Reformatted some specs to be more idiomatic (Thank you Federico Builes)

=== July 10, 2008

  * Added algorithm complexity information for all Containers
  * Implemented Trie for string representation
  * Implmented SuffixArray for fast substring search
  * Fixed memory leak in CRBTree
  * Updated Manifest and algorithms.rb to match progress

=== July 9, 2008

  * Implemented Deque
  * Stack and Queue now use Deque
  * Fixed issues with CRBTree's #empty? and delete methods

=== July 8, 2008

  * Can now iterate over a heap
  * Renamed #contains_key -> has_key? since it's more idiomatic
  * Implented #change_key and #delete for Heap
  * Priority Queue is now implemented with the new Fibonacci Heap
  * Removed old Priority Queue code as a result
  * Heap: fixed #delete bug not checking if item exists, #has_key? bug 
          for not returning boolean
  * Heap: value field is now optional and defaults to the key if not specified
  * More refactoring of RBTreeMap (both Ruby and C)
